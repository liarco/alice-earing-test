# Alice - Hearing test
## A simple web-based application to test your hearing.

I created this web-app just for fun as a speed coding challenge.
It's not complete, it doesn't follow many best practices, long story short: **don't take it too seriously**.

Build:
```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

Run:
```bash
yarn start
# Follow instructions...
```
