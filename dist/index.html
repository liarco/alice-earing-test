        <h1>Alice - Hearing test</h1>

        <p>
            Hi, welcome to <strong>Alice</strong> an extremely basic web-app to test your hearing
            against different frequencies.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>
            Once you start a new round a few sounds will be played at random intervals. Press the
            <strong>spacebar key</strong> once each for each sound you can hear.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each keypress will be checked as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Right guess:</strong>
                you are right! A new sound is playing right now</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Retrigger:</strong>
                a sound is actually playing, but you already spotted it a few moments ago... are
                you cheating?!??</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bad guess:</strong>
                you are wrong! Nothing is playing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You can run 3 test modes:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>From LOW to HIGH:</strong>
                the frequencies will play from the lowest to the highest
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>From HIGH to LOW:</strong>
                the frequencies will play from the highest to the lowest
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To random:</strong>
                the frequencies will be picked randomly from the available ones <em>(read below for
                fine-tunings)</em>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Where is the GUI?!?</strong><br>
            This project is just a proof of concept so no real GUI has been developed. You can open
            the devtools to check the status and final results on different log levels (debug, info,
            warning and error).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Input is not working... #@?!</strong><br>
            Please make sure that the current focus is on the page, use the widget below to test
            it.
